Bruce Batchelor is an accomplished innovator across many fields (publishing, fundraising, training, strategic planning and organizational change, stakeholder engagement, health and social change initiatives, credit union governance, etc.). He has been leading a consortium of consultants (including Todd Litman), nonprofits, academics and practitioners who have collaborated on the proposed "trip reduction program" for BC. TRP4BC would require all large employers (over 8,700 organizations, employing 57% of BC's workforce) and major trip generators to assess and report on the emissions, vehicle-kilometers-travelled and mode used, for their employees' commutes, clientele's travel and local delivery; and then make and report on best efforts to improve on those metrics. Metro Vancouver is advocating for the BC Government to include this program in the upcoming Clean Transportation Action Plan.
