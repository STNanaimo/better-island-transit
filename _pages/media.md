Todd Litman spoke with Radio-Canada about Better Island Transit. BC Transit claims thereâ€™s little demand for additional services, but we argue that better service would attract more riders. Our goal is to have hourly buses with reasonable fares. Weâ€™ve met with provincial officials, who acknowledge the issue but point to existing funding. We need more support to create a reliable intercity transit network.

Ryan speaks with Todd Litman, president of Better Island Transit, about the need for improved interregional transit service on central and southern Vancouver Island, including the development of a transit planning and funding agreement between Capital, Cowichan and Nanaimo regional districts, BC Transit and the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure that would see hourly bus service between Duncan and Victoria for much of the day.
