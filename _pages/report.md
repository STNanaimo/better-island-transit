More frequent and affordable bus services connecting South and Central Vancouver Island would help many travellers and communities, is far more cost effective, faster to implement, and provides more total benefits than other transportation improvement options. For these reasons, regional districts, BC Transit and MoTI should implement frequent and affordable bus service in 2025.

## Provincial Sustainable Transportation Policy Recommendations

Our recommendations for sustainable transportation policy in British Columbia to improve mobility, reduce congestion, and lower emissions.

Todd Litman argues that improving public transit services, such as increasing the frequency and affordability of bus routes #66 and #70, would provide greater benefits, reduce environmental impact, and better serve the community compared to the highway expansion.
