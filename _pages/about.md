Frequent and affordable public transit service can provide convenient independent mobility for travellers who cannot, should not or prefer not to drive on Island highways. It also _reduces road congestion, crashes and pollution emissions_. It supports local economic development by helping students access school, workers access jobs, businesses access employees and tourists access rural areas. It helps create more livable, equitable and successful communities.

Our short-term goal is to increase frequency and reduce fares for bus service between Duncan and Victoria (#66) and between Duncan and Nanaimo (#70). This will provide convenient and affordable public transportation from central Vancouver Island to Victoria and Sooke.

### Island Highways Carries Roughly 30,000 people Per Day

It's often congested, dangerous and sometimes closed due to crashes, flooding and rockfalls. It's costly and environmentally damaging to expand, and it lacks mobility options for non-drivers. Every few years the provincial government develops proposals to reduce traffic problems on this corridor. These focus on costly roadway expansions, which only benefit motorists, or rail which would provide limited service with high fares. They give little consideration to frequent and affordable bus service.

Many community groups and local tribes oppose efforts to widen the highway through Gold Stream Park due to environmental concerns, and high-speed rail service that would impose noise and danger.

### Transit Along The Island Highway Is Infrequent And Expensive 

Between central and south Vancouver Island, transit service is currently infrequent and expensive. The Duncan-Victoria link has only four daily buses, with no reverse commute or off-peak service and $10 one-way fares.

- **Qualicum Beach/Parksville/Nanaimo** (#91, 50 kms, 52 minutes) has 18 daily trips with $2.50 one-way fares. Less than 1% transit mode share.
- **Nanaimo/Duncan** (#70, 50 kms, 70 minutes) has 7 daily trips with $7.50 fares. Less than 1% transit mode share.
- **Duncan/Victoria** (#66, 60 kms, 75 minutes) has only 4 daily trips with $10 one-way fares. Less than 1% transit mode share.
- **Sooke/Victoria** (#61, 40 kms, 70 minutes) has 43 daily trips with $2.50 fares. More than 20% peak-period transit mode share.

Provincial leadership is **necessary** to plan intercity public transit services that connect island communities. This would be a model for other intercity transit connections.
