We are a group of activists, subject-matter experts and citizens lobbying for convenient and affordable better public transportation on Vancouver Island.

Frequent and affordable public transit service can provide convenient independent mobility for travellers who cannot, should not or prefer not to drive on Island highways. It also reduces road congestion, crashes and pollution emissions. It supports local economic development by _helping students access school, workers access jobs, businesses access employees and tourists access rural areas_. It helps create more livable, equitable and successful communities.

Transit service between central and southern Vancouver Island is currently infrequent and expensive, particularly between Duncan and Victoria. Our longer-term goal is to create a model for planning intercity public transit services throughout Vancouver Island and throughout British Columbia.
