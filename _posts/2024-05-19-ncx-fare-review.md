Better Island Transit and [Strong Towns Nanaimo](https://www.beautifulnanaimo.ca/) are unified in our advocacy for more frequent and affordable intercity transit. In response to the RDNâ€™s ongoing fare review, we would like to comment on the price of the #70 NCX route between Nanaimo and Duncan. Currently, there are only seven daily trips that cost $7.50 which account for less than 1% of transportation mode share on the corridor. If a resident in Nanaimo wishes to visit Victoria, _they'd have a round-trip cost of $35_. 

We at both Better Island Transit and Strong Towns Nanaimo believe that frequency and affordability is key to increasing transportation mode share along the corridor. Residents in Nanaimo and Duncan deserve access to competitive public transportation options between the RDN and the CVRD. The current cost of the #70 NCX is expensive enough to deprive non-drivers of independent mobility and forces many commuters to spend more than they can afford on vehicle travel. It also increases Island Highway traffic congestion and crashes, and increases pollution emissions.

In a typical community, 20-40% of travelers cannot, should not or prefer not to drive and will use non-auto modes if they are convenient, comfortable and affordable. These include many people with disabilities, low incomes, adolescents, tourists, and motorists who temporarily lack a vehicle, plus people who value exercise or want to avoid the stress of driving on busy roads Families wishing to visit Victoria for the day must leave no later than 7:57 am to connect in Duncan before reaching Victoria at 10:24 am. For the return trip, they must leave Victoria by 5:15 pm to reach Nanaimo at 8:07 pm. It is not possible to visit Nanaimo from Victoria by transit and return the same day; commuters must leave Victoria in the afternoon, arrive in Nanaimo at night, and return early in the morning. This limited schedule is unsuitable for most trips, and the fares are comparable to vehicle operating costs so travelers have little incentive to take public transit rather than drive

**We want hourly service along the #70 route with a $5 maximum one-way fare.**

This would provide many benefits to transit users and their communities. It is the most cost-effective way to reduce Malahat traffic problems and provide many co-benefits. We donâ€™t want to leave people behind! Residents in both the RDN and the CVRD deserve better, faster, and more affordable intercity transit options. It took a decade to establish the #70 NCX connection â€“ we donâ€™t want to wait another decade for the service to be competitive with personal vehicles.
